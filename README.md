# Should I Backup My .com

Just a joke hack I made at Yahoo! OpenHack 2009. The idea is you type in a product like Yahoo, Flickr, Delicious, etc, and it will tell you whether it thinks you should backup your data for this site or not. It uses the Guardian API and Yahoo pipes to get the data.

During the presentation I hacked it a bit and added easter eggs when you typed stuff in like Geocities and Mangolia.
